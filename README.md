# Eco-Friendly Horn Project
# Project Overview
The Eco-Friendly Horn Project aims to reduce noise pollution caused by vehicular horns by using a system that wirelessly transmits horn signals between vehicles. Instead of relying on loud external sounds, the system triggers internal alerts (such as lights) in other vehicles, ensuring effective communication without increasing the noise level on the roads.

# Features
Noise Reduction: Minimizes external sound pollution by replacing loud horn sounds with internal vehicle alerts.
Distance Detection: The system calculates the distance between vehicles to avoid unnecessary alerts and ensure safety.
Wireless Communication: Uses wireless transceivers to transmit horn signals to nearby vehicles.
Real-Time Alerts: Instantaneous internal alerts via lights or other means in response to received horn signals.
Safety Enhancement: Designed to maintain road safety by ensuring vehicles are aware of their surroundings.
# Technologies Used
Microcontroller: Handles signal transmission and reception.
Wireless Transceivers: Facilitates communication between vehicles.
Distance Sensor: Measures the distance between vehicles to ensure signals are only sent when necessary.
LED Indicators: Provides internal visual alerts within the vehicle.
# How It Works
When a vehicle honks its horn, the sound is detected by the system's microphone.
The sound signal is processed and transmitted wirelessly to nearby vehicles.
Upon receiving the signal, the recipient vehicleâ€™s system checks the distance between the two vehicles.
If the distance is within a pre-defined safe range, the system triggers an internal alert (e.g., flashing lights) in the recipient vehicle.
This process ensures that the driver of the recipient vehicle is notified without the need for external noise.
# Installation
Hardware Setup:
Install the transceivers and microcontrollers in both the transmitting and receiving vehicles.
Set up the distance sensor and internal light indicators.
Software Installation:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/eco-friendly-horn.git
Upload the software to the microcontroller.
Customize the parameters (e.g., distance threshold) based on your needs.
# Usage
Power on the system in both the transmitting and receiving vehicles.
The system will remain idle until it detects a horn sound.
If a horn is detected, the signal will be transmitted and the receiving vehicle will display a visual alert.
Adjust the system's sensitivity as necessary for optimal performance.
# Future Improvements
Vibration Alerts: Add vibration-based notifications for drivers who might miss the visual alerts.
Mobile App Integration: Develop a mobile app to configure system parameters and view received alerts.
Advanced Filtering: Implement filtering algorithms to distinguish between genuine horn sounds and ambient noise.
